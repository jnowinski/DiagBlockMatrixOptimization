#Problem Statement and Requirements
Consider a matrix A of size Rndxnd, composed of n^2 non-overlapping blocks of d x d matrices. Where each dxd block, Dij, is a diagonal matrix.
Design and implement a spatially and algorithmically efficient data structure to represent such matrices and provide efficient algorithms for common matrix operations, such as matrix multiplications, addition/subtraction, transpose, inverse/pseudo inverse, determinant, eigenvalue/eigenvector calculations, and SVD
